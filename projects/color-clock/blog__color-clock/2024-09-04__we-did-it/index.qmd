  Ten years in the making and ColorClock was deployed at Burning Man
  2024 🥳 It worked the whole week and I didn’t even need to break open
  the backup electronics box 😅

## Contingency Planning

I packed up spares of all the electronic components in case one of the
modules were to go kaput. Time didn’t allow to solder up an entire new
circuit board so my contingency plan was to construct a new one with a
solderless prototyping board if anything went really wrong.

*The backup box had multiples of all the modules in addition to
solderless breadboards and assorted components.*

*I also brought my little tool box with oodles of extra wire and tools
Thankfully I had no use for any of my extra wiring.*

## Artery Check In

During check-in, The Artery (the Burning Man art department) showed us
our placement on the map.

*Part of the check in ritual is to have the artist place a label near
the green sticker corresponding with their project on the art map. I was
ecstatic to see my little green dot* 🤩

*There we are!*

After identifying our placement on the map, the Field Ops volunteer
took us to our actual location on Playa.

*Each project’s physical location is marked with a “floofy” connected
to a CD-R bolted into the ground.*

## Installation

The 2-day, 16 + 2 hour drive to Playa was a little nerve-racking. My
poor Subie was at her towing capacity, and let us know with her engine
whines. But we made it 😅

![](./cody-and-bo-unloading.JPEG)
*We were able to transport the project mostly assembled to make set up
as easy as possible. Our good friend Cody was part of our art crew and
helped with the construction.*

*Bo is getting the solar panels set up. The wooden box in front of the
solar panels housed the battery and solar charge controllers.*

It had been raining the day before and we were frantically trying to
finish assembly before the looming rain. I felt some droplets while I
was connecting the light harnesses to the terminal block but we got
everything buttoned up without any damage. Due to the threat of rain, we
decided to wait until all chances of precipitation had passed before
powering up.

*Many art installations at Burning Man are designed for climbing, but
ColorClock was not, so we needed a sign to make that clear. Additionally
I wanted to ensure participants were aware of the trip hazard posed by
the cross beams at the bottom. My campmate Heather had the chance to
experiment with a Cricut and created some super cute signs for us 😍.*

*I added curtains to the sides of the structure in a futile attempt at
making the lights visible during the day, but the Playa sun always
wins ☀️ So it turned out to be just a nighttime piece.*

## Nighttime Viewing

While the colored LEDs were not visible during the day, the colors
shined through beautifully at night.

*Bo and I were delighted to see how vibrant the colors glowed at night.

This recording is the tail-end of my presentation where I encouraged
my campmates to explore the control panel, figuring out how the
buttons influenced the central light. Video courtesy of Victoria Hollis.

*I invited my camp to view the piece and gave a brief presentation
explaining the meaning behind the colors of each LED strip in the
light display.*

Over the course of the event, almost all of our solar lights to
provide safe visibility were destroyed. My amazing camp member, Kerry
Veenstra, who also had a piece on Playa, lent us some spare lights
that added beautiful lighting to the ground. Photo courtesy of
Victoria Hollis.

## Participant Interaction

On a different note, event participants found my piece difficult to
engage with. ColorClock was vandalized twice with mean stickers, and
no one I spoke to at the project had the vaguest idea of what they
were looking at or what the buttons actually did.

*My camp mate Kerry found this sticker on my piece and promptly removed
it. This was the second time someone had vandalized my art. I didn’t
take it personally, but it saddens me that some people think it's
acceptable or amusing to deface a project that someone has invested so
much time and effort into. Photo courtesy of Kerry Veenstra.*

🌈

Regardless of how ColorClock was consumed by the public, I’m still
damn proud of what we accomplished. And this project wasn’t for anyone
one else - it was for me. The magic of ColorClock was in the software
which I did not have the time or mental capacity to translate into the
visual aesthetic.

## The End of ColorClock Version 1

Many of the art pieces at Burning Man are burned, which I believe
symbolizes the impermanence of life. Though our choice to burn our
piece was mostly because we simply didn't want to lug it home 😅 A
ceremonial burn-in-place ritual is quite complex due to the need to
protect the playa. Instead, we opted to disassemble the piece and burn
it in the "Burn Garden."

Before disposing of the structure, we salvaged the electrical
components and removed all fasteners.


Cody and Bo disassembled the project and removed all screws. Our
friend and campmate Asher (not pictured) was helpful in removing
staples from the battery box and played a significant role in
conducting a MOOP sweep of the area. In Burning Man culture, MOOP
stands for Matter Out Of Place. A MOOP sweep involves meticulously
combing the area for any debris to uphold the principle of "Leave No
Trace."




Only unpainted, untreated wood was permitted in the Burn Garden which
is why we left the wood  in the structure unfinished. Here, Bo is
tossing our disassembled structure into the "Burn Garden".


## ColorClock Version 2?

I have a lot of ideas of how to modify ColorClock to be more palatable
for the viewer and how to improve the design. So there will definitely
be a version 2. Here is a short list of ideas for improvement:


- Use individually addressable LEDs.
- Design and create a printed circuit board.
- Modify lights in control panel to respond instantaneously to
  participant input.
- Come up with a better user interface.
- Make it smaller, reducing the need for a huge trailer.
- Make it cuter. Burners like cute things.


But there’s another project I’ve been contemplating for a few years so
maybe that will be the next endeavor. I’m going to let this year’s
experience settle for a bit before I decide on my next project…


## Thank You 🙏

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to several individuals who
made significant contributions to ColorClock:


**Bo**, my partner in project creation and life, played a crucial role in
designing and singlehandedly constructing the physical structure. His
support gave me the confidence to see the project through to completion
even during challenging times. Bo assisted with troubleshooting both
hardware and software issues, provided invaluable guidance on software
design, including teaching me how to create a state machine, and
helped me master Git rebase to keep the ColorClock repository organized.


**Cody** was incredibly helpful in numerous ways, from lifting heavy
objects and loading to taking turns driving the large and unwieldy
trailer. Beyond his practical support, Cody’s presence at Burning Man,
his assistance with building and striking camp, and his joy and
playfulness were heartwarming and made the experience even more special
His support was deeply appreciated.


**Kerry** mentored me during the early stages of software design and
inspired me to bring art to the Playa. Kerry also generously loaned
and installed new solar lights for my piece when the originals were
damaged and has been a steadfast advocate for both my well-being and
my art.

**Heather** created charming signs that truly brought the piece together,
adding a special touch to the overall presentation.

**Austin** assisted with 3D printing my test models for the electronics box
providing a protective enclosure for the circuit board during its time
on the Playa.

**Asher** assisted with our MOOP sweep and the disassembly process, ensuring
that everything was handled efficiently and effectively.

**Trevor**, our Artery liaison, answered all our questions and provided
exceptional support throughout the project.

To all my campmates with the **Funguys**, thank you for your warmth and
unconditional support. You all are truly family to me 🥰

Finally, I’d like to extend my gratitude to the **Burning Man
organization** for providing a platform to present ColorClock and for
showcasing a diverse range of art and experiences. Their efforts
create an environment where unique and extraordinary art forms can
truly thrive.
