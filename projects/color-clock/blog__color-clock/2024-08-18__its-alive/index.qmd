  Our scheduled live demo pushed us to finish the project just in time.
  The event was a success and I even got to play teacher again 👩‍🏫

The outer ring cycles through the whole spectrum over 24 hours, the
second to the outer ring cycles over one hour, the inner ring cycles
over 1 minute and the central flower-looking light can be controlled
by the participant. This photo was taken at 9:09 AM. Don't mind the
dead button LED. This will be fixed 😅

## No Regrets

For a long time, I regretting getting my bachelor's in electrical
rather than computer engineering. Often enough I have questions about
software engineering design concepts that might have been answered had
I chosen a different major. However, while working on ColorClock I
realize that my degree gave me familiarity with electronic components
and datasheets that I might not have gotten with a different
undergraduate focus. And for the first time since I graduated, I
sincerely have no regrets about my choice.

A lot has happened since the last post, including completely
resoldering a new circuit board followed by a very sad afternoon where
I was ready to give up after burning *another* Arduino board. But Bo
came to the rescue and discovered that it was just a grounding problem.

Here is the final wiring of the circuit board. Isn't it beautiful? 🥰

## We Did It!

A couple months ago we decided to schedule a live demo as motivation
to get the project finished a week before leaving. The looming
date of the demo gave us the motivation to finish with exactly one
weekend to spare to get ready 😵‍💫

Last weekend was the demo and it was a success! After scrambling to
get it all wired up (which involved an embarrassing number of
alligator clips), I threw together a slide deck that I presented to
kick off the event. I added some of the slides at the end of this post
for your enjoyment.

I discussed some of concepts of RGB LEDs, how a level shifter works, and
explained the wiring of the circuit board. I was excited to play

## The Final Touches

This is our last weekend before we deliver and I'm thrilled that we
are really just putting on the final touches. Although I learned today
that last minute software changes can be quite risky.

I decided to change the initial colors for the the participant
controlled central light, but because of the wonky logic for how the
buttons interact with the colors, I got less ideal results.

I reverted my software change and now it's working 🥳

I've included a few slides below for your enjoyment 🙂 These diagrams were
created using AutoCAD.
