What time is it?
Amber o'clock-ish(?)

## What is it?

ColorClock is a decade-long passion project that combines art with
engineering and color with time. In simple terms, it's a
clock that displays time through color instead of symbols.
For me, it represents perseverance and pride, and stands as the most
hard-earned engineering accomplishment I had taken from conception to
design to full deployment.

ColorClock V1 was an RGB LED art installation displayed at
Burning Man 2024. It was a simple circular light display housed in a
practical lean-to structure with a bench.
