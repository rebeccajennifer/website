# Salutations!

My name is Rebecca.

## Who I Am

I am an engineer and movement coach, but most of all, an educator.
I am passionate about sharing my knowledge, whether it be about
computers or movement. I find satisfaction in lifting others up and
leaving every space I occupy in a better state than I found it. My two
favorite things are handstands and rabbits 🐰
