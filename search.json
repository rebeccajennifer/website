The harness then led to a 12-way terminal block mounted on the structure, which interfaced with the electronics box.\nThe diagram above was generated using DOT, a scripting language for creating vector images. It’s another technology I use at work and have recently started incorporating into ColorClock.\n For home display, we removed the wire harness from Version 1 and directly connected the LED strips to the terminal block, which we relocated to the back of the light display."

I felt some droplets while I was connecting the light harnesses to the terminal block but we got everything buttoned up without any damage. Due to the threat of rain, we decided to wait until all chances of precipitation had passed before powering up.\n Many art installations at Burning Man are designed for climbing, but ColorClock was not, so we needed a sign to make that clear. Additionally I wanted to ensure participants were aware of the trip hazard posed by the cross beams at the bottom. My campmate Heather had the chance to experiment with a Cricut and created some super cute signs for us 😍.\n I added curtains to the sides of the structure in a futile attempt at making the lights visible during the day, but the Playa sun always wins ☀️ So it turned out to be just a nighttime piece."

Instead, we opted to disassemble the piece and burn it in the “Burn Garden.”\n\nBefore disposing of the structure, we salvaged the electrical components and removed all fasteners.\nCody and Bo disassembled the project and removed all screws. Our friend and campmate Asher (not pictured) was helpful in removing staples from the battery box and played a significant role in conducting a MOOP sweep of the area. In Burning Man culture, MOOP stands for Matter Out Of Place. A MOOP sweep involves meticulously combing the area for any debris to uphold the principle of “Leave No Trace.”\nOnly unpainted, untreated wood was permitted in the Burn Garden which is why we left the wood in the structure unfinished.

Beyond his practical support, Cody’s presence at Burning Man, his assistance with building and striking camp, and his joy and playfulness were heartwarming and made the experience even more special His support was deeply appreciated.\nKerry mentored me during the early stages of software design and inspired me to bring art to the Playa. Kerry also generously loaned and installed new solar lights for my piece when the originals were damaged and has been a steadfast advocate for both my well-being and my art.\nHeather created charming signs that truly brought the piece together, adding a special touch to the overall presentation.\nAustin assisted with 3D printing my test models for the electronics box providing a protective enclosure for the circuit board during its time on the Playa.\nAsher assisted with our MOOP sweep and the disassembly process, ensuring that everything was handled efficiently and effectively.\nTrevor, our Artery liaison, answered all our questions and provided exceptional support throughout the project.\nTo all my campmates with the Funguys, thank you for your warmth and unconditional support. You all are truly family to me 🥰\nFinally, I’d like to extend my gratitude to the Burning Man organization for providing a platform to present ColorClock and for showcasing a diverse range of art and experiences. Their efforts create an environment where unique and extraordinary art forms can truly thrive."

Talk to others.\n\n\n\nReview all your notes after every class starting from the beginning of the quarter. Redo all of the examples, and complete any examples not covered in lecture. Spending time to strengthen your knowledge foundation will serve you in completing the assignments.\n\n\n\nYou will inevitably run into bugs that you have to fix. This often takes way longer than you might think to resolve. Starting assignments early enables you to catch these issues early on so you are not panicked at the 11th hour.\n\n\n\nRewrite the homework with different numbers. Solve this new version of the homework.\n\n\n\nIf you feel that you’ve been “doing the things” and are not improving, reflect upon the approach you are taking. Are you hitting roadblocks in your process? Talk to others and form a new plan."

In this “computer engineering 101” course, I restructured the curriculum and taught foundational concepts including binary, digital logic design, memory alignment, and assembly language.\nMy favorite topic to teach was data path where I guided students through how an assembly instruction breaks down into machine code and how those ones and zeros flow through the processor.\nThis page contains the course material from that class to serve as a reference for anyone interested, and as an example of my work in education, documentation, and curriculum design."
