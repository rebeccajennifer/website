In this “computer engineering 101” course, I restructured the curriculum and taught foundational concepts including binary, digital logic design, memory alignment, and assembly language.\nMy favorite topic to teach was data path where I guided students through how an assembly instruction breaks down into machine code and how those ones and zeros flow through the processor.\nThis page contains the course material from that class to serve as a reference for anyone interested, and as an example of my work in education, documentation, and curriculum design."
